# Normalization for System F

These are a snapshot of some slides I put together on Girard's proof of strong normalization for System F.

The goal here is to go through the proof essentially as Girard does in _Proofs and Types_ but in greater detail. There are some typos, and likely some errors, but it may still be of use as a companion to the proof in the book.
